<h1 id="serviceComponents">Service Components</h1>

<p>
  Service components in Slice.js handle business logic and data operations without a visual representation. They provide reusable functionality that can be shared across visual components, serving as the backbone of your application's data layer and business logic.
</p>

<h2 id="serviceComponentOverview">What are Service Components?</h2>
<p>
  Service components in Slice.js:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Handle data operations, API communication, and business logic</li>
  <li>Don't have visual representation or DOM elements</li>
  <li>Can be shared across multiple visual components</li>
  <li>Often follow the singleton pattern (one instance shared throughout the application)</li>
  <li>Provide a clean separation between UI and business logic</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="buildingServiceComponents">Creating Service Components</h2>
<p>
  Here's a basic example of a service component that fetches and caches data from an API:
</p>
<div class="service-example"></div>

<h2 id="usingServiceComponents">Using Service Components</h2>
<p>
  Services are built using <code>slice.build()</code> just like visual components, but they interact differently with the application:

<div class="service-usage-example"></div>

<h3 id="fetchManager">FetchManager</h3>
<p>
  The FetchManager service simplifies API communication with features like automatic loading indicators, timeout handling, error management, and response caching:
</p>
<div class="fetch-manager-example"></div>

<h3 id="localStorageManager">LocalStorageManager</h3>
<p>
  The LocalStorageManager service provides a simplified interface for working with browser localStorage, including automatic JSON serialization and error handling:
</p>
<div class="local-storage-example"></div>

<h3 id="indexedDbManager">IndexedDbManager</h3>
<p>
  The IndexedDbManager service offers a simplified API for working with IndexedDB, providing methods for CRUD operations on object stores:
</p>
<div class="indexed-db-example"></div>

<h3 id="translator">Translator</h3>
<p>
  The Translator service enables internationalization in your application, allowing you to support multiple languages:
</p>
<div class="translator-example"></div>

<h2 id="customServices">Creating Custom Service Components</h2>
<p>
  You can create custom service components for specific application needs. Here's an example of a custom authentication service:
</p>
<div class="custom-service-example"></div>

<h2 id="serviceComponentBestPractices">Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Single Responsibility</strong>: Each service should focus on a specific domain or functionality</li>
  <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: Implement robust error handling and logging within services</li>
  <li><strong>Caching Strategy</strong>: Use appropriate caching strategies to improve performance</li>
  <li><strong>Service Composition</strong>: Compose complex services by combining simpler services</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: Pass dependencies to services through their constructors</li>
  <li><strong>Consistent API</strong>: Design service APIs with consistent naming and behavior patterns</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="sliceCard">Slice Card</h1>
<div class="sliceCard">
  <p>
    When building a "Card" component, by default it's created with the Slice
    logo, and with a default title and text.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="myCard">
  <h2 id="myCard">Title and Text</h2>
  <p>
    To build your own Slice Card with your information it's as simple as just
    adding "title" and "text" props to your component.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="cardClick">
  <h2 id="cardClick">Click Event | "isOpen" prop</h2>
  <p>
    The Slice Card component has an click eventListener. While the card is
    uncovered and shows the information inside, it's cover can be clicked to
    keep open. Changing it's "isOpen" prop to true. That same eventListener can
    change it back to false, and cover up the card again.
  </p>
</div>
<h1 id="customization">Customization</h1>
<div class="cardIcon">
  <h2 id="icon">Icon</h2>
  <p>
    You can start your Slice Card customization by assignin another icon to it.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="cardColor">
  <h2 id="customColor">Custom Color</h2>
  <p>
    You can also change card color by using "customColor" props, using
    "customColor.card" to change it's background, and "customColor.icon" to
    change the icon's color.
  </p>
</div>

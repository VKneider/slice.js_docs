<h1>Slice Documentation</h1>
<p>
  The Slice Framework is a modular system based on components, designed to simplify web client development. Its architecture allows functionality to be divided into reusable modules, making maintenance and expansion easier.
</p>
<p>
  Components are classified into three main categories: <span>Visual</span>, <span>Structural</span>, and <span>Services</span>. Visual components build the user interface, structural components manage the frameworkâ€™s core infrastructure, and service components handle business logic and integrations.
</p>

<div class="visualComponents">
    <h2>Visual Components</h2>
    <p>
        These components define the web client interface using custom HTML tags powered by the Web Components API. They encapsulate logic for dynamic styling, UI interactions, and backend communication via HTTP requests.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="structuralComponents">
    <h2>Structural Components</h2>
    <p>
        Structural components provide the core framework infrastructure, managing instances, tracking activities, and optimizing performance. They ensure seamless control over application behavior and debugging.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="serviceComponents">
    <h2>Service Components</h2>
    <p>
        Services encapsulate business logic and facilitate integrations with technologies like HTTP requests, local storage, and IndexedDB. They promote code reusability and simplify application development.

<h1 id="routing">Routing in Slice.js</h1>
<p>
  Slice.js provides a powerful and flexible routing system that allows you to create single-page applications
  with multiple views. The routing system is built on top of the browser's History API and offers both
  declarative and programmatic ways to define and navigate between routes.
</p>

<h2 id="router-setup">Router Setup</h2>
<p>
  Slice.js routing starts with defining your routes in a configuration file. By default, Slice.js looks for
  this configuration in <code>src/routes.js</code>, but you can customize the path in <code>sliceConfig.json</code>.
</p>

<div class="routes-config-example"></div>

<p>
  The route configuration consists of an array of route objects, each with at least a <code>path</code> and a 
  <code>component</code> property. The router uses this configuration to match URL paths to components.
</p>

<div class="routing-visualization"></div>

<h2 id="route-component">Using the Route Component</h2>
<p>
  The <code>slice-route</code> component is the simplest way to define a route in your components. It renders the specified
  component when the current URL matches the defined path.
</p>

<div class="route-component-example"></div>

<p>
  When defining a route component, you need to specify:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>path</strong>: The URL path that triggers this route</li>
  <li><strong>component</strong>: The name of the component to render when the path matches</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="multi-route-component">Using the MultiRoute Component</h2>
<p>
  The <code>slice-multi-route</code> component allows you to define multiple routes in a single component. This
  is particularly useful for sections of your application that have multiple related views, like dashboards or
  content management systems.
</p>

<div class="multi-route-example"></div>

<p>
  The MultiRoute component takes an array of route objects through its <code>routes</code> property. Each route
  object has the same structure as in the main routes configuration.
</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-routes">Dynamic Routes with Parameters</h2>
<p>
  Slice.js supports dynamic routes with URL parameters. You can define parameters in your route paths using the
  <code>${paramName}</code> syntax. These parameters are then passed to your component through the <code>props.params</code> object.
</p>

<div class="dynamic-routes-example"></div>

<p>
  When a dynamic route matches, the parameters are extracted from the URL and made available to your component.
  This allows you to create reusable components that can display different content based on the URL parameters.
</p>

<h2 id="navigation-methods">Navigation Methods</h2>
<p>
  Slice.js provides multiple ways to navigate between routes: programmatically using the router API, 
  and automatically through anchor elements.
</p>

<h3 id="programmatic-navigation">Programmatic Navigation</h3>
<p>
  Use the <code>slice.router.navigate()</code> method for programmatic navigation in your JavaScript code.
  This is ideal for conditional navigation, redirects, or navigation triggered by user actions other than link clicks.
</p>

<h3 id="anchor-navigation">Anchor Element Navigation</h3>
<p>
  The router automatically intercepts clicks on anchor elements (<code>&lt;a href="/path"&gt;</code>) 
  for internal links, providing seamless navigation without page reloads. No special setup is required - 
  just use standard HTML anchor elements and the router handles the rest.
</p>

<h4>Automatic Link Interception</h4>
<p>
  Any anchor element with an <code>href</code> attribute pointing to an internal path will be automatically 
  handled by the router. The browser's default navigation is prevented, and the router performs the navigation 
  using the History API instead.
</p>

<h4>Links that are NOT intercepted</h4>
<p>
  The router intelligently avoids intercepting certain types of links to preserve expected browser behavior:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>External links</strong>: Links to different domains (<code>https://example.com</code>)</li>
  <li><strong>Special protocols</strong>: Links using <code>mailto:</code>, <code>tel:</code>, <code>ftp:</code>, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Hash links</strong>: Links starting with <code>#</code> for same-page anchors</li>
  <li><strong>Download links</strong>: Links with the <code>download</code> attribute</li>
  <li><strong>Target attributes</strong>: Links with <code>target="_blank"</code>, <code>target="_top"</code>, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Marked as external</strong>: Links with <code>class="external-link"</code> or <code>class="no-intercept"</code></li>
  <li><strong>Data attributes</strong>: Links with <code>data-no-intercept</code> or <code>data-external</code></li>
</ul>

<div class="programmatic-nav-example"></div>

<h2 id="enhanced-link-component">Enhanced Link Component</h2>
<p>
  For situations where you need additional functionality beyond standard anchor elements, Slice.js provides 
  a Link component that can be built programmatically with enhanced features.
</p>

<h2 id="nested-routes">Nested Routes and Layouts</h2>
<p>
  Slice.js supports nested routes, which are powerful for creating complex UIs with shared layouts. You can
  define child routes in the route configuration, and they will inherit the parent route's path as a prefix.
</p>

<div class="nested-routes-example"></div>

<p>
  In this example, the AdminLayout component acts as a container for all administrative pages, providing a
  consistent layout while the content area changes based on the current route.
</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-route-management">Dynamic Route Management</h2>
<p>
  The router supports adding, removing, and updating routes at runtime, providing flexibility for dynamic applications:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Add routes</strong>: <code>slice.router.addRoute({ path: "/new", component: "NewComponent" })</code></li>
  <li><strong>Remove routes</strong>: <code>slice.router.removeRoute("/old-path")</code></li>
  <li><strong>Update routes</strong>: <code>slice.router.updateRoutes(newRoutesArray)</code></li>
  <li><strong>Get all routes</strong>: <code>slice.router.getAllRoutes()</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="router-statistics">Router Statistics and Monitoring</h2>
<p>
  The router provides detailed statistics for monitoring and debugging:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialization status</strong>: Check if the router is fully initialized</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation state</strong>: Monitor if navigation is currently in progress</li>
  <li><strong>Active route</strong>: Get information about the currently active route</li>
  <li><strong>Cache statistics</strong>: Monitor component caching performance</li>
  <li><strong>Route matcher stats</strong>: Get information about registered routes</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="route-lifecycle">Route Lifecycle and Events</h2>
<p>
  When a route changes, Slice.js router triggers several events:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The previous component is removed from the DOM (with component pooling for reuse)</li>
  <li>The new component is built and inserted into the DOM</li>
  <li>If the new component has an <code>init</code> method, it's called</li>
  <li>If switching between routes that use the same component, the <code>update</code> method is called instead</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="performance-optimization">Performance Optimization</h2>
<p>
  The router includes several performance optimizations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Component pooling</strong>: Reuses component instances when possible to reduce memory allocation</li>
  <li><strong>Route caching</strong>: Caches route matching results for faster navigation</li>
  <li><strong>Event throttling</strong>: Prevents rapid successive navigation events from overwhelming the system</li>
  <li><strong>Lazy loading</strong>: Components are only loaded when their routes are accessed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="route-best-practices">Best Practices for Routing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Organize your routes logically, grouping related routes together with nested routes</li>
  <li>Use the most specific component for your routing needs - Route for single routes, MultiRoute for related groups</li>
  <li>Keep route parameters simple and descriptive</li>
  <li>Add a catch-all 404 route to handle unmatched paths</li>
  <li>Use standard anchor elements (<code>&lt;a href="/path"&gt;</code>) for navigation links - the router handles them automatically</li>
  <li>Use the Link component for enhanced functionality when you need additional features</li>
  <li>Mark external links appropriately with <code>target="_blank"</code> or <code>class="external-link"</code> to prevent router interception</li>
  <li>Consider adding loading indicators during navigation, especially for routes that fetch data</li>
  <li>Use the programmatic navigation API for complex navigation scenarios like redirects or conditional navigation</li>
  <li>Take advantage of dynamic route management for applications with changing route requirements</li>
  <li>Monitor router statistics in development to optimize performance</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Links not working</strong>: Check if the link is being intercepted correctly or if it falls into one of the excluded categories</li>
  <li><strong>Route not found</strong>: Verify that the route is properly defined in your routes configuration</li>
  <li><strong>Components not loading</strong>: Ensure component names match exactly between routes and component registration</li>
  <li><strong>Performance issues</strong>: Use router statistics to identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly</li>
</ul>
